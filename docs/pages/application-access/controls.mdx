# Application Access Role-Based Access Control

## Assigning Labels to Applications

Teleport Application Access uses labels to allow/deny access to the proxied
web applications.

An application can be assigned static and dynamic labels via configuration:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "grafana"
  uri: "http://localhost:3000"
  # Static labels.
  labels:
    env: "prod"
    group: "metrics"
  # Dynamic labels.
  commands:
  - name: "arch"
    command: ["uname", "-p"]
    period: 1m0s
```

## Configuring Application Labels in Roles

User roles can be configured to allow or deny access to applications with
specific labels via `app_labels` property.

For example, this role will grant access to all applications from the group
"metrics", except for the production ones:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    # At least one login must be present (even if invalid), otherwise user
    # won't be allowed to log into the web UI.
    logins: ["keep-this-value-here"]
    app_labels:
      group: "metrics"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

## Integrating with Identity Providers

Role application labels can be populated dynamically based on the claims and
attributes received from identity providers using template variables with
`external` prefix.

For example, this role will have its "env" and "group" label values set after
the Okta user's attributes with the same names:

```yaml
allow:
  app_labels:
    env: "{{external.env}}"
    group: "{{external.group}}"
```
